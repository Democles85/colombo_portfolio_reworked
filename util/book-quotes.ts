// We exist within dimensions, and you are moving at your own pace, from the deepest darkness and the most primitive ignorance to divine experiences that you wouldn’t dare attempt to explain.

// No one will defeat you if you are based in consciousness.

// You are experiencing the expansion of your consciousness.
// It doesn’t matter what awareness flows within you; what matters is whether you are using the wisdom of your heart.

// You must prepare on how to live consciously in this reality, because everything that moves, moves from a greater hypnosis within the universe. Quiet yourself in self-denial and pray, seeking only awareness to become truly conscious. It will come when you open your heart.

// Release your spirit and break free from the illusion that has gripped your aura for your energy to radiate and be liberated in a true dimension.

// We must become more mature and focus on serving each other in our truths and our spirits. Speak, suggest, comment, oppose, debate with maturity, play, caress, joke, and even be ironic if it carries the right sweetness, love beautifully, speak, don’t agree, and do all of this loudly, defending your truth.

// As time passes, everything is becoming clear about who we were and who we are.
// Who was right, who claimed, and who had a greater truth.
// Who created art with themselves and who created art with the souls of others.
// It is evident who no longer belongs to our hearts.
// It is clear who truly abused and who forcefully sought to be beautiful in our eyes, but deep down proved they belong neither to beauty nor to truth.
// There is no greater art than the elevation of the spirit and the effort to resist being polluted and fallen.
// All those who raised things for the eye, not the soul, will fall.

// We will soon be confronted with what kind of consciousness to use.

// If you are afraid, this is the greatest form of enslavement you are imposing on your spirit.

// As soon as you accept that everything is energy, a great thirst to be filled with divine energy begins. After this realization, the entire purpose of existence becomes nothing more than the evolution of our energy. We begin striving to understand and realize at what energetic level we wish to live. It is a great ignition of the spirit, seeking to connect with the deepest divine energies. A game so powerful and intoxicating for all those spirits that wish to ascend.

// Understand something: The Great Architect created our energy without needing to be raised or taught by anyone. Everything is connected to everything.
// Remember: We are creating the reality we want. Trust on that.
