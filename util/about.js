            In my journey of self-healing and as a seeker of silent knowledge
          </span>
          , I found nothing more sacred than consciously touching the body in a
          divine way with energy and love. I realized that our healing comes
          through the connection of body, mind, and spirit, as our entire
          history is embedded within our physical, emotional, and spiritual
          bodies. I was tired of all the salvation philosophies, sensing that
          the world is more in need of something sensible that makes us feel
          alive and gives us life.

          after a colorful and eventful life, I moved to Iceland. There,
          everything I had accumulated since childhood erupted in a divine
          manner amidst the volcanic mountains of Akureyri. From that day on, I
          was not the same. I experienced four blessed months, slipping into
          divine dimensions and exploring various states of consciousness. It
          was an expansion of consciousness, a psychic shock, and a divine
          blessing that burst my heart open with ecstasy. I spent a long time
          processing and understanding everything that had unfolded within me.
          Everything became transparent to me, and I became highly sensitive to
          reality. I can say that divine, high-frequency energies remained for a
          long time, healing me.

            A full inner belief that what was happening to me was a blessing

          Humbleness and conciousness became my pillars, making me allow and

            After four months in Iceland

          , , I moved to Spain, still reflecting on what had happened. Through
          meditation and deep inner journeys, I began experimenting with energy
          work on myself at a multidimensional level. Seeking understanding, I
          looked for similar spiritual people online and connected with many who
          had experienced mystical and spiritual phenomena. I delved deeply into
          studying quantum physics, shamanic wisdom, Hinduism, Buddhism, and
          other traditions and their approach to energy work. Following numerous
          teachers, including Elliot Saxby and Chris Bale, I enriched myself. In
          September 2024, I attended a three-week training with Elliot Saxby,
          observing, learning, and navigating what resonated with me. The
          greatest gift I received from this course was learning to love even
          more what I myself had created as something compatible and authentic
          to me. For this, I am deeply grateful to Elliot Saxby as an authentic
          teacher.

          lifestyle, staying awake at night and sleeping during the day. I
          continued meditated for hours, purging myself deeply. During this
          time, I experienced an intimate encounter with the universe—a divine
          experience requiring devotion, humility, and respect. I have dedicated

          returned to my homeland, seeking like-minded individuals. I spoke with
          many wonderful people but sensed that some were in delusion,
          discussing spirituality without having had genuine mystical
          experiences. To avoid judgment, for them and from them, I distanced
          myself. I began experimenting with close friends, realizing that
          everyone is capable of transformation; they only need someone who
          approaches them with love and understand humans in their dimensions.
