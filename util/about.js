            In my path of healing
          </span>
          , as a seeker of knowledge, I found nothing more sacred than
          consciously touching the body in a divine way, full of energy and
          love. I understood that healing comes through the body, as our entire
          story is within our bodies. The world is tired of healing
          philosophies, so there is a great need for something alive to shake
          us, make us feel and give us life.

            Ever since I was a child
          </span>
          , I have been quite intuitive. This was further amplified when I
          started determining people&apos;s characters without knowing anything
          about them. Something spiritual burned inside me and I spent a large
          amount of time believing I should chase this gift within me. The scent
          of a fresh and spiritual person has always been alive within my eyes.

          connect with my higher self. Not long after, living like that became
          the new normal, and I started to understand myself, reality, and
          everything that surrounded me. The more I familiarized myself with
          this gift, the more wonders I saw.

          , this feeling deepened, making me able to sense even finer energies,
          such as hidden traumas or shadows, understanding them on a spiritual
          level. I created portfolios of a kind, which I dubbed “energy
          passports” for everyone I met; who that person was, what their divine
          gifts were, and what aspects of themselves should they work on.

          people on every level and dimension, such as various psychic needs,
          blocks, traumas, etc., as well as support higher energies that want to
          awaken. Every session is lively, deep, and full of energy.
