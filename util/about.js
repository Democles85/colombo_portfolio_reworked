            In my path of healing
          </span>
          , as a seeker of knowledge, I found nothing more sacred than the
          subconscious and spiritual touch of the body, full of divine love. I
          understood that healing comes through the body, as that is where all
          the history is written. The world is tired of healing philosophies, so
          it needs something alive that rocks us, makes us sensitive, and gives
          us life.

            Ever since I was a child
          </span>
          , I have been quite intuitive. This was further amplified when I
          started determining people&apos;s characters without knowing anything
          about them. Something spiritual burned inside me and I spent a large
          amount of time believing I should chase this gift within me. The scent
          of a fresh and spiritual person has always been alive within my eyes.

            After a very colorful life

          , my affinity for fine energies was enriched, as I had managed to
          connect with my higher self. Not long after, living like that became
          the new normal, and I started to understand myself, reality, and
          everything surrounding me. The deeper I went with my gift, the more
          miracles happened.

          , this feeling deepened, making me able to sense even finer energies,
          such as hidden traumas, understanding them on a spiritual level. I
          created portfolios of a kind, which I dubbed “energy passports” for
          everyone I met; who that person was, what their divine gifts were, and
          what aspects of themselves should they work on.

          I spent 4 months on Iceland, where I tapped into high divine energies

          on yourself through me, this is transformable work. After many
          experiences and gifts from the universe, I am equipped to support
          people on every level and dimension, such as various psychic needs,
          blocks, traumas, etc., as well as support higher energies that want to
          awaken. Every session is lively, deep, and full of energy.
