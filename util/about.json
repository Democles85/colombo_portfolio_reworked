    {
      "paragraph": "In my path of healing, as a seeker of knowledge, I found nothing more sacred than the subconscious and spiritual touch of my body, full of divine love. I understood that healing comes through the body, as that is where all the history is written. The world is tired of healing philosophies, so it needs something alive that rocks us, makes us sensitive, and gives us life."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Ever since I was a child, I have been quite intuitive. This was further amplified when I started determining people’s characters without knowing anything about them. Something spiritual burned inside me and I spent a large amount of time believing I should chase this gift within me. The scent of a fresh and spiritual person has always been alive within my eyes."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "After a very colorful life, my affinity for fine energies was enriched, as I had managed to connect with my higher self. Not long after, living like that became the new normal, and I started to understand myself, reality, and everything surrounding me."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "The deeper I went with my gift, the more miracles happened. In my spiritual development, this feeling deepened, making me able to sense even finer energies, such as hidden traumas, understanding them on a spiritual level. I created portfolios of a kind, which I dubbed “energy passports” for everyone I met; who that person was, what their divine gifts were, and what aspects of themselves should they work on."

    {
      "paragraph": "In 2018, I spent 4 months on Iceland, where I tapped into high divine energies and I was no longer the same. I dove into a sea of consciousness, where my heart opened and made me more sensitive to this reality."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "4 months later, I moved to Spain and reflected on what happened to me. After a long series of meditations and spiritual journeys, I started experimenting on energy works."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "I then moved to Italy, where I had an intimate experience with the universe, and from then on, I have had many mystical experiences. What is all of this about my heart, you may ask. It is nothing more than me chasing it and letting the universe do its work."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "After everything that happened to me, I felt and understood what it means to understand and work on energy. I understood that on all of the Bodywork sessions, everyone is prone to transformation, they just need a self-consciousness to support themselves."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "In February of 2020, I started supporting people professionally. To all who want to work on yourself through me, this is transformable work. After many experiences and gifts from the universe, I am equipped to support people on every level and dimension, such as various psychic needs, blocks, traumas, etc., as well as support higher energies that want to awaken. Every session is lively, deep, and full of energy."
